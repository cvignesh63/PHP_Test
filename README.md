# PHP TO-DO Calendar
My sample PHP testing project to get familiar with PHP. 

Basically will show the monthly calendar of the year and allows to view the events for each day. 

We can add, edit events for each day on our preferred time period. The events will be shown as per the scheduled time in events.

PHP has been used for the backend code; HTML, javascript and CSS on the client side. mySql for the backend DB.
